# ZipBoard Intern Challenge
---
### Make a Public Feed using Meteor.Js

Write a cloud app, that provides a discussion board to its customers (imagine it to be similar to facebook, but much simpler). The application should have two screens/pages: (1) landing page should be a log-in page, where a customer can provide an email/password to create/log-in into the application, and (2) once the user is authenticated, he should be taken to the discussion board (similar to facebook), where he can add his/her comment to the feed. There should be a text box on top to enter the comment, and below this text box, the feed should show up. The feed should show the email ids of the user, and the entered comments in chronological order.
Pretty straight forward, and simple application. Please use the METEOR framework to write this application. An excellent tutorial to get you started with METEOR framework can be found at (www.meteor.com). Once you get done, host your code on GitHub, and send us the GitHub url.

### Installation and setup:

**Note:** The Application requires meteor framework installed. If not already installed, visit the links below:
